# nextjs-client-ffmpeg

This is a NextJS webapp capable of converting multimedia files through ffmpeg 
on the client-side

## Motivation

Although many webapps like this already exist, I really wanted to create my own 
to learn more about WebAssembly and ffmpeg. So this is what came out of that 
small idea which was grown by the hate of using publicly available conversion 
websites.
